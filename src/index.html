                <h3>Why do we use the Solana blockchain?</h3>
                <p>The Solana blockchain is known for its high speed and low transaction costs, making it an ideal choice for storing media checksums securely and efficiently. By using the blockchain, we ensure that the checksums are immutable and publicly verifiable, which helps prevent deepfakes and unauthorized modifications.</p>

                <h3>Why do we need to connect a wallet?</h3>
                <p>Connecting a wallet allows us to authenticate your identity and link your media checksums to your account securely. It also enables you to manage your assets and transactions on the blockchain.</p>

                <h3>Why do we need to create an account and upload payload?</h3>
                <p>Creating an account on the blockchain allows us to store your media checksums securely. Uploading the checksum payload ensures that your media files are registered on the blockchain, making it easy to verify their authenticity.</p>

                <h3>What is the commission that will be paid?</h3>
                <p>When you upload a checksum, a small commission is paid to cover the transaction costs on the Solana network. This fee helps maintain the network's security and performance. Another small fee is paid to the developer, in order to cover the development and updates made on the platform.</p>
